Plan for Handling Temporary Files
Information Gathered:

A total of 276 files matching the temporary file patterns were found.
The files include various .cjs, .bak, .final.tsx, .fixed.tsx, and .test.tsx files, which are typically used for testing or as backups.
Plan:

Review Temporary Files:

1. Identify which of the found files are truly temporary and can be removed.
2. Check if any of the .test.tsx files are still in use for testing purposes.
3. Categorize files into three groups: 
   a. Files that can be safely removed
   b. Files that require further review
   c. Files that are still in use

Categorization of Temporary Files:

1. **Files that can be safely removed**:
   - All `.bak` files
   - All `.final.tsx` files
   - All `.fixed.tsx` files

2. **Files that require further review**:
   - `.test.tsx` files (might still be used for testing)

3. **Files that are still in use**:
   - `.cjs` files (used in various scripts and configurations)

Create a Backup:

Before removing any files, create a backup of the identified temporary files to ensure no important data is lost.
Use a version control system to track changes and maintain a record of removed files.

Remove Temporary Files:

Delete the identified temporary files from the codebase.
Use automated scripts or tools to remove files efficiently and minimize manual errors.

Update Documentation:

Document the changes made, including which files were removed and why.
Update relevant documentation to reflect the new codebase structure.

Dependent Files to be Edited:

No specific files need to be edited, but the removal of temporary files may affect any references in the codebase.
Perform a thorough code review to identify and update any affected references.

Follow-up Steps:

1. Verify the removal of files and ensure that the codebase is functioning correctly after the cleanup.
2. Update any relevant documentation regarding the changes made.
3. Schedule regular codebase cleanups to maintain a organized and efficient codebase.

Update:

The following files were not found during the deletion process and might have already been removed or were never present:

1. tsconfig.json.bak
2. tsconfig.paths.json.bak
3. BookingForm.fixed.tsx
4. BookingForm.final.tsx

No further action is required for these files.
