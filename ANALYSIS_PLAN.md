# Comprehensive Codebase Analysis Plan for IndiCab

## 1. Codebase Structure and Key Files
- The project is a modern cab booking service built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
- Key directories:
  - src/app: Next.js app router with main pages and layouts.
  - src/components: Atomic and feature-based UI components.
  - src/context: React context providers for state management.
  - src/lib: Shared utilities and helper functions.
  - src/services: API clients and backend integration.
  - src/styles: Global and modular CSS styles.
  - src/types: TypeScript type definitions.
  - scripts: Utility scripts including image optimization.
  - tests: Unit and E2E test suites.
  - storybook: Component stories for UI development.

## 2. Dependent Files to Read for Full Understanding
- UI components under src/components/features for marketing, booking, and other features.
- Context providers in src/context for state and auth management.
- API service files in src/services for backend communication.
- Utility files in src/lib for shared logic.
- ErrorBoundary component (missing or path issue) for error handling.
- Configuration files like next.config.mjs, tailwind.config.js, and tsconfig.json.

## 3. Error Handling and Best Practices
- Usage of ErrorBoundary components for robust UI error handling.
- API service functions with try-catch and meaningful error messages.
- Loading spinners and Suspense for graceful async UI loading.
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety.
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
- Testing with Vitest and Playwright for unit and E2E tests.

## 4. UI/UX Features and Integration Points
- Responsive, accessible UI with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.
- Animated UI using Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
- Use of Google Fonts and Lucide icons.
- Real-world feature sets like booking forms, featured cars, popular routes.
- Integration with Stripe for payments.
- Use of external stock photos (Unsplash) for hero images.
- LocalStorage sync for favorites system.

## 5. Use of Images and Assets
- Images stored under public/assets with WebP optimization.
- Lazy loading with blur placeholders.
- Automatic redirects from legacy image paths.
- Maintenance scripts for image optimization.

## 6. Testing and Deployment
- Unit tests with Vitest.
- E2E tests with Playwright.
- Storybook for UI component development.
- Deployment configured for Netlify and Vercel.
- Docker Compose setup for local MongoDB and Redis.

## Notes and Follow-up
- Verify and fix the missing ErrorBoundary component path or file.
- Review scripts for database connection and API testing.
- Explore context providers for auth and booking state management.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to best practices and coding standards.
